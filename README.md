# AI in Rust

A simple rust program to call ChatGPT API from command line with markdown to ANSI output.
This project replaces `aid` (written in Dart) and implement `chatgpt` and `llama-cpp`.

### Note

This project is an excuse for me to discover Rust, it might (certainly) need optimizations.

### Install

On ArchLinux :
```
cd archlinux
makepkg -si
```

Other :
```
cargo install
```
(Note: this will install air in $HOME/.cargo/bin by default)


### TODO

- [x] Llama cpp support
- [ ] Publish AUR
- [ ] Any idea ?
